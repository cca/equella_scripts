## Take an Informer export CSV & put into EQUELLA-ready upload format.
## Note: no column headers in Informer export & multi-value
## handling set to "comma-separated" or the script breaks

## Usage:
## ./course-csv-to-taxo.pl course-list.csv > output.csv
## Then take output.csv & run through EQUELLA upload script
## (not in this repoâ€¦yet)

## if the script isn't working make sure to set permissions
## for the file to be executable
## chmod 755 ProcessFiles.pl

## A couple of settings that make the warnings more verbose
## Also makes the programming a little less forgiving
use warnings;
use strict;

## Declaring the variables - good programming
my $term;
my $program;
my $coursename;
my $faculty;
my $coursecode2;
my $coursecode;
my $xlist;
my $facultyuid;
my @linearray;

## if there are no arguments print the usage block
## if there are more than one argument barf and make
## a suggestion

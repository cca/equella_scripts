# openEQUELLA Scripts

Various scripts used in VAULT (our openEQUELLA instance). The scripts are categorized by where they're used:

**asc** contains Advanced Scripting Controls used in Contribution Wizards.

**bookmarklets** are browser-side JS meant to aid in copying useful oE URLs.

**fine-arts-jr-review** is a script for biannual updates to certain data in oE.

**retention** scripts are tools for applying the [VAULT Retention Policy](https://portal.cca.edu/essentials/technology-services/web-services/vault/vault-retention-policy/).

**user-scripts** contains bulk metadata update tools meant to be run from the _Manage Resources_ section.

**utilities** are scripts for bulk processing that Manage Resources cannot handle such as downloading files, manipulating user groups, or generating taxonomies. They often interact with oE via its REST API.

## Notes

Note that node is needed for some of the scripts that interact with the API and `npm install` in the root of this project will get you the necessary dependencies.

openEQUELLA's internal JavaScript engine is most likely Mozilla's [Rhino](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/Rhino), for what it's worth. That means modern JavaScript features (e.g. ES5 stuff like `Array#map`) are not available.

Probably the biggest gotcha I've found working with openEQUELLA's JavaScript is that the return value of `xml.get` on an empty metadata node _is not strictly equal to empty string_ (`xml.get('thisdoesnotexist') !== ""`). That's why conditions through these scripts will employ `!=` or `==` when checking against strings returned by `xml.get`.

## Testing

`npm test` runs the retention procedures' tests. They require a separate .equellarc file specific to the tests at the path retention/test/.testretentionrc (there is an example file provided).

As tests are added to other utilities, they will need to run Ã  la carte. I'm usually only working on one utility at a time and it doesn't make sense to run tests over all of them, especially because they tend to involve HTTP requests and thus are quite slow. View the package.json scripts for shortcuts to different tools' tests.
